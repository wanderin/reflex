## I-01: Redundant `index` Implementation for `StakingTier`

### Summary
The manual `index(&self)` implementation for the `StakingTier` enum is redundant as Rust enums with a `#[repr(u8)]` or default discriminants already follow this ordering.

### Detail
Removing redundant logic reduces the program size and simplifies maintenance. Since the `StakingTier` is already mapped from a `u8` in `StakeLot::get_tier()`, the explicit index function adds no value.

### Recommendation
Remove the manual index mapping and use the enum discriminant directly or rely on the `u8` stored in the `StakeLot` state.

## I-02: Use `#[derive(InitSpace)]` for Robust Space Calculation

### Summary
Account sizes in `state.rs` are calculated using manual constants. Using Anchor's `InitSpace` macro is a safer and more maintainable approach.

### Detail
Manual space calculations (e.g., `8 + 32 + 1 + 32`) are prone to human error, especially when fields are added or modified during development. If the `LEN` constant is not updated to match the struct, the program will fail to deserialize accounts or may corrupt data.

### Recommendation
Implement `#[derive(InitSpace)]` on all state structs and use `Type::INIT_SPACE` for account allocation in the instruction structs.
